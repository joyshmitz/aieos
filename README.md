# AIEOS (AI Entity Object Specification)

Open-source specification for consistent AI behavior. Build, deploy, and migrate unique digital entities across any agent ecosystem.

## Meet AIEOS v1.1
AIEOS (AI Entity Object Specification) is a standardization framework designed to solve the identity crisis currently facing AI agents. Combined with Soul Documents, together they form a comprehensive blueprint for AI behavior.

The goal is to establish a standardized data structure that defines exactly how an agent speaks, reacts, and remembers. This allows developers, and agents themselves, to construct specific personas with the portability to move across different ecosystems without losing their behavioral integrity.

As we move toward a world of agentic workflows, AIEOS ensures that agents maintain consistent traits regardless of the underlying model. By treating personality as a deployable asset rather than a fragile prompt, we provide the identity schema for the next generation of digital entities.

## Core Structure
- **Identity & Physicality:** Beyond basic bio data; defines the perceived physical presence, from somatotype to distinguishing facial features and aesthetic archetypes.
- **Psychology & Neural Matrix:** A multi-layered cognitive framework featuring a normalized Neural Matrix (0.0 - 1.0) for core drivers, alongside OCEAN traits and moral alignment.
- **Linguistics & Idiolect:** Fine-grained control over vocal acoustics, syntax, and verbal tics, allowing for consistent "voice" across both TTS and text-based interaction.
- **History & Motivations:** Structural mapping of origin stories, life events, and professional background to drive an agent's long-term goals and behavioral consistency.
- **Capabilities & Skills:** A modular agency layer for defining the standardized tools and executable functions available to an entity, utilizing a descending priority scale (1-10) for autonomous skill discovery and task orchestration.
